# Ethical Scraper Project

## Overview

The Ethical Scraper is designed to perform web scraping in an ethical manner, ensuring compliance with legal and ethical standards. It includes features for initial domain scanning, DPIA screening, and Legitimate Interest Assessment (LIA) to determine the ethical viability of scraping activities.

## Features

- **Domain Scanning**: The scraper scans a domain to determine if wildcard access is allowed and identifies rate limits set in the robots.txt file or specified by the user.
  
- **Setup Wizard**: Guides users through initial setup, including domain scanning and configuration of scraping parameters.
  
- **DPIA Screening**: Conducts a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) to evaluate the impact of scraping on data subjects and compliance with data protection regulations.
  
- **Legitimate Interest Assessment (LIA)**: Users answer a series of questions to assess if scraping activities align with legitimate interests under GDPR and similar regulations.
  
- **Confidence Rating**: Uses inputs from LIA to generate a confidence rating using a Legal Language Model (LLM) to help inform users before proceeding with scraping activities.
